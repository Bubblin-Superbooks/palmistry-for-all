The day I had this interview, Lord Kitchener, or, as he was then, Major-General Kitchener, was at the War Office, and to take this impression had to use the paper on his table, and, strangely enough, the imprint of the War Office may be seen at the top of the second fingerâ€”in itself perhaps a premonition that he would one day be the controlling force of that great department.</p></div> </div>
