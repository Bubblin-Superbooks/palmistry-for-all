The greatest attention should be paid to it, so as to obtain a clear grasp of the Mentality under consideration.</p><p>The two hands must be carefully comparedâ€”the left showing the inherited tendencies, the right the developed or cultivated qualities. The slightest change or deviation in the markings from the left to the right should be carefully noted down or remembered.</p></div> </div>
