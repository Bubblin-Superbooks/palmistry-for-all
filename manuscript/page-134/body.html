<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Influence Lines</h3><p class="  start-chapter">When any small line joins the Fate Line or goes on with it as an attendant line, such a mark usually indicates marriage at the date when these lines join . If, on the contrary, these lines do not join, marriage with the person is not likely to occur although the affection and influence will be present in the career.</p><p>When one of these influence lines appears by the side of the Fate Line and crosses through it towards or on to the Mount of Mars, it indicates that the influence thus shown will turn to hate and will injure the career of the person on whose hand it is found .</p></div> </div>
