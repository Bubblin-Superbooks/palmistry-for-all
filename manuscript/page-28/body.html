Such persons are deceptive and treacherous. They may smile at you with their lips, but instinctively they regard you as their prey and will only use you for their own object.</p><p>A soft, fat hand is the indication of an indolent and more or less lazy person.</p><p>A firm hand is the sign of an energetic, reliable nature.</p></div> </div>
